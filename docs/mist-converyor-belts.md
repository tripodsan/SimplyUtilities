# Overview

**Conveyor Belts** are constructs that when stepped on, cause the player to be moved about.
**Conveyor Belts** are constructed by placing a block of magenta glazed terracotta, one block of wool of any color, and a concrete block of a color listed below.  
The wool and the concrete are interchangeable, but the terracotta must be at the bottom.  

# Behaviour

The rotation of the terracotta determines what direction the belt moves in, and the color of the concrete effects the speed:  
- Red: 1  
- Orange: 2  
- Yellow: 3  
- Lime: 4  
- Blue: 5
